# DataStructures and Algorithms

## Introduction

##### This repository is especially to help myself develop the problem solving skills considering the importance. I've been practising the problems on different data structure and applying the Algoriths that i've been learning over the period. 

## what are datastructures?

##### In a nutshell data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification

## what is Algoirthm?

##### Algorithm is nothing but a logical technique to solve a given problem more effieicntly. In this project i've been practising different algorithms to help with solve diffrent problem statements.

## what are the take aways?

##### Those of you who is looking up to this repo, he/ she be able to find below

##### 1. Popular DS and ALGO problems that have been discussed on various coding platforms
##### 2. Approach to solve the problem
##### 3. O-notations for each problem (both time and space)
##### 4. A few famous Algorithms
