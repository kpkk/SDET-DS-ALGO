Day 6 HW:
1.Understand Math functions (Min,Max- static methods)
2.Bitwise Operator


Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].

Return the answer in an array.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3] 1,2,2,3,8-->
Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
Explanation:
For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3).
For nums[1]=1 does not exist any smaller number than it.
For nums[2]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1).
For nums[3]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1).
For nums[4]=3 there exist three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [6,5,4,8]
Output: [2,1,0,3]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [7,7,7,7]
Output: [0,0,0,0]


Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 500
0 <= nums[i] <= 100


-------------------------------------

Given an integer array arr, count how many elements x there are, such that x + 1 is also in arr. If there are duplicates in arr, count them separately.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 and 2 are counted cause 2 and 3 are in arr.
Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7]
Output: 0
Explanation: No numbers are counted, cause there's no 2, 4, 6, or 8 in arr.
Example 3:
Input: arr = [1,3,2,3,5,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: 0, 1 and 2 are counted cause 1, 2 and 3 are in arr.
Example 4:
Input: arr = [1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: Two 1s are counted cause 2 is in arr.
Example 5:
Input: arr = [1,1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: Both 1s are counted because 2 is in the array.
