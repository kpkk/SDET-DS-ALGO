Abstraction:
hiding the implementation from the consumer and offering only the functionality
Abstraction can be achieved through
- interface (A template, which helps enforcing design rules, also until java 1.7 only supports abstract methods)

- abstract class (its a class, which can have a partial implementation of implemented interface)
       - we can make a class as abstract by specifying the abstract keyword, it can  also have all concrete methods
Keyword:-  we use implement keyword to implement the interface
benefits:- design first and build later strategy, we can let the down streams have their own implementation
properties:-
we can't instantiate the abstract class,

Java:-
Map, List and their implemented classes are the good examples for abstraction

selenium:-
RemoteWebDriver class is implementing the searchContext interface

In framework:-
In framework, the first component developed was the interface which has the definition set for all the methods that needs implementation

we also have ab abstract class (which is a reporter class), it has one abstract method which is "takeSnap". This method is implemented by the other classes
