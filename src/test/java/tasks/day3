Assignment for Day 1
-------------------------
1. why any programming language design starts with implementing interfaces and annotations then abstract class


Interface:-

1. Interface is a template which provides the total abstraction and loosely coupling
2. Interfaces defines the capability, class that implements the interface must implement all of its methods unless its an abstract class
3. Every method/ variable that we define in interface is public static final default
4. Since java doesnâ€™t  support multiple inheritance, it supports through the interfaces
5. Since java 8 we can implement default methods in interface so that the implemented classes are unaffected
6. We can also add static methods in the interface and these can be called without having to create an object, with interface name  we can call

Interface programming is used to implement modular programming at component level in OOP language
Interface based programming language provides advantages over the packages even if the component contains only one package

In interface based programming defines the application as collection based , the communication between the component (API) happens through interfaces this enhances the modularity and availability
