How do you work on parallel execution on multiple machines, where we need to upload files paralley

executing the selenium scripts on multiple platforms (OSs, browsers) to reduce the execution time

We had 400 scripts in our suite, which were executed only on one machine before, which used to take around 2 hrs for execution.

This slower execution delaying the regression runs, and eventually affecting test life cycle

then to mitigate the risk, we introduced selenium grid as an option, where we use one machines as host and 4 other machines are nodes

these machines will share the scripts and execute , which has resulted in a execution time of 1 hr

With this option we are also achieving the multiple platforms and browsers execution

later this is also integrated with jenkins pipeline for nightly execution

we have eliminated the duplicate code base, only client has the code and it os being shared with nodes
