How do you handle cross browser testing/ multiple versions

Cross browser testing is testing of the web application in various browsers to ensure that there aren't any compatibility and design related issue
such as no overlapping, style and properties of element are intact such as width , height, breadth

however all browsers are same, but the way they load HTML,CSS, java script is diff hence testing in all browsers is must

In one opf our client applications, there was a requirement to test the application in safari and edge alongside chrome and firefox

we studied the requirement and understood that we need a cloud platform that provides multiple versions and types of browser

we understood that there are some cloud providers such as browser stack, saucelabs and perfecto, ghost labs
finally made a decision that to go with browser stack,
from selenium implementation perspective, we pass the browser name and version as a parameter in the testNg.xml for each test case

testNG helps us with @parameter annotation to parameterize the browser name

the browser config file would be available in cloud that fetches the information and provides the respective browsers
in that way we have achieved an extensive coverage with respect to different browsers
