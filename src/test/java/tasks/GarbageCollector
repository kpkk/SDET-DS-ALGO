Garbage collector-
 the process of destroying the unused objects to free up memory. java has automatic garbage collection process which is being run by JVM

 but in c/ c++ developer has to take care of resource allocation and de-allocation, else we run into memory out of errors

we can also request JVM to run the garbage collector, by calling

System.gc() method
Runtime.getRunTime().gc();


when an object is no longer refferred and unused then it is eligible for garbage collection
ways to make object to eligible for GC
-by nullifying it
-by reassigning the reference variable
-object created inside the method

before the garbage collector acts the finalize() method from the object class would be executed, which will esnure all tear down activities are done
