Day 2 HW:

-----------------
1.Understand String Builder reverse method internally and O notations(Swap) - reviewed with team
2.Learn Eclipse debug video / Short cuts as a team - just had a walk through

---------------------------
3.Why generics are not supported to primitive data type - done

ava is statically types here,  type of the value is known at compile time

It eliminates the casts and stronger checks at compile time

Using generics we can make our classes or interfaces a generic one that means it can support multiple types

Java generics are built using Type-erasure concept meaning that symbol would get replaced by the actual type we send

Primitives or not of reference types , so generics only support class objects

Wrapper classes provide a way to implement these with the help of auto-boxing and unboxing techniques


* Java primitive types are not reference types (e.g. an int is not an Object)
* Java does generics using type-erasure of reference types (e.g. a List<?> is really a List<Object> at run-time

-------------------------------

4.Try to do 1 pass for remove a value in integer array - done
5.Find peak element is an element that is strictly heater than its neighbour - done

problems:-
-----------------
1) Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

2) Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element. you may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times.

3) Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be unique and you may return the result in any order.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2]

4) Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2

5) Given an array of integers arr, write a function that returns true if and only if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique.
 
Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
Output: true
