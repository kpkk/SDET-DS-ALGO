Selenium questions


How selenium works internally

Selenium RC - built on JS

Initially developed for HTML driver, later firefox came

This code is not supporting the other browser

For browser—> html, JS, css, images

Css - will display stylesheet

Run time errors thrown by JS script (validation at client level)

Images are stored in server
In console we can wrote java script


How to run on multiple browsers,

Simon Stewart in 2009 presented…

Then selenium team we support this for all the browser

It should  be language independent, browser independent

Competitor —> puppeteer , cyprus(only supports chrome)—> node js

Selenium architecture

The language calls the RESTFUL API using json (older)/w3c wire protocol (newer version)


The selenium while taking to browser, it needs a driver file.  Chromedriver (local server) written in python, js, c++

Lay gecko driver


The seleniumm jar, calls the API of chomedriver,


Chrome driver will run on 9515

/session. —> to open browser

{
Desired capabilities:{
Browser: chrome
}
}

/session/sessionid/window/maximize


/url to launch the url
/GetSessions-> get call
/element —> {using: id value:path}

Selenium web driver —> language binding Api, that communicates to the browser with list of actions

Web driver manager will run a new browser

Web driver.chrome.driver—> get property

findFreeport—> will give a random port

creteAcceptablePort-> synchronised  to give only one port number to one


All exceptions also thrown using API calls

Get calling GetCommand —> commonPayload method—> it call execute method


Get will generate an immutable map

It is following the Okhttp commnds


Exceptions are thrown by chromedrver

Selenium implements NoSuchElementException to era the message received from chromedriver


Find element
Interact

Element reference has changed
When we find an element, the element was there, but the reference is missed in the chrome driver…hence selenium is complaining- statelement exception

Wait until the page is loaded properly
Use retry logic, call the method recursively

timeBound,  iteration

All ExceptedConditions will use recursion

ExpectedCondition.stelnessof()


Common exceptions we get

When we get it, what do we do

staleElementReferenceExceptions
TimeOutExceptions- when excepted conditions fails

1. Increase the webdribver wait
2.  Correct expected conditions


NoSuchElementException- when element to be found can’t be located with the locator given
InvalidSelectorException- when we try to use wrong selector on a webElement
ElementNotInteractableException - when we try to interact with element whose state is not ready
NoSuchFrameException - when the frame can’t be located
NoAlertPresentException - when there is no alert but we are trying to handle
UnhandledAlertException
NoSuchWindowException- when the window doesn’t present to switch
webDriverException
elementclickinterceptedexception
Invalidelementstate exception

NotFoundException is parent of all no such exceptions
1.  element is not there in Dom
  2.  The implicitly wait is not designed



How do we switch to a new window that is opened newly

Using get window handles, we an get the set of windows, convert them into list then switch to the last index


LHS—> foreach—> math tilet —> break
Convert into list-> get thhe index
Iterator
How do you handle authentication pop up
For chrome :-  http://username:password@url
Other ways—> AutoIT/ Tikuli—> will not work during parallel run
devTools—>network authentication—> inject into the web driver—> will work all except IE

We can use java script executor , pass the credentials in URL
Using auto IT

How do you handle applications like Facebook, how do we know that we reached the end of the page

Scroll down- store elements Int list, again scroll down, get the elements, if the elements are same then stop doing it, else keep scrolling

Lazy loading- it will not load all the data,



How do you handle cross browser testing/ multiple versions

How do you work with selenium web driver when the code base is not throwing exception

How do you deal with dynamic table
How do you get the PDF downloded

How do you work on parallel execution on multiple machines, where we need to upload files paralley
