P1) Given an array nums of integers and integer k, return the maximum sum such that there exists i < j with nums[i] + nums[j] = sum and sum < k. If no i, j exist satisfying this equation, return -1.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [34,23,1,24,75,33,54,8], k = 60
Output: 58
Explanation: We can use 34 and 24 to sum 58 which is less than 60.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [10,20,30], k = 15
Output: -1
Explanation: In this case it is not possible to get a pair sum less that 15.

Solve this in less than O(n) time complexity


P2) Given an array arr of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer k. Find the kth positive integer that is missing from this array.
 
Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.

Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.


P3) There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values). Prior to being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4

----------
Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.
If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]
Example 2:
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
Example 3:
Input: nums = [], target = 0
Output: [-1,-1]

----------

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1
Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4
Example 4:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 0
Output: 0
