Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

Whenever you see a question that asks for the maximum or minimum of something and that has negative numbers in it, consider Kandane Algorithm as a possibility.

Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer k, return the kth smallest subarray sum.
A subarray is defined as a non-empty contiguous sequence of elements in an array. A subarray sum is the sum of all elements in the subarray.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,1,3], k = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: The subarrays of [2,1,3] are:
- [2] with sum 2
- [1] with sum 1
- [3] with sum 3
- [2,1] with sum 3
- [1,3] with sum 4
- [2,1,3] with sum 6
Ordering the sums from smallest to largest gives 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6. The 4th smallest is 3.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,3,5,5], k = 7
Output: 10
Explanation: The subarrays of [3,3,5,5] are:
- [3] with sum 3
- [3] with sum 3
- [5] with sum 5
- [5] with sum 5
- [3,3] with sum 6
- [3,5] with sum 8
- [5,5] with sum 10
- [3,3,5], with sum 11
- [3,5,5] with sum 13
- [3,3,5,5] with sum 16
Ordering the sums from smallest to largest gives 3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 16. The 7th smallest is 10.
