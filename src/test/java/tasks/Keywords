Keywords:-

Static:-
its a keyword, this can be used with class, methods, blocks and variables
when we specify something as static, it gets stored in class area, and the initialization would have happen even before the constructor is invoked
also only one copy of value is shared across multiple instances of the call
static members can be accessed without specifying the object, by just specifying the class name
static member access is faster compare to object, as these members reside in class area
static members would be alive until the class is loaded in JVM, only after the objects were destroyed then only static members are eligible for garbage collection

Java:
String class join , Arrays class sort, copyOfRange, fill....sre some examples of static method

Selenium:-
in selenium all the methods under By class as id, name, xpath, cssSelector as static methods

Framework:-
we declare our webdriver object as public static, also we have some static utils


final-
final is a keyword which can be used with classes, methods and variables
when we make something as final the value can't be changed
final classes can't be extended
final methods can't be overridden
final variables can be labeled with static
the values for global / instance variables can only be set through constructor

keyword: final
benefits: data intigrity, guaranteednes

java
String class is final

Selenium
yet to update----------------

finalize:-
finalize is a method, which is used juts before the object is destroyed.
garbage collector calls the finalize method once it determines that the object alive is no longer has reference and can use that
this is responsible for resource de-allocation, killing of unused objects by JVM
