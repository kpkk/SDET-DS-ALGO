    /*

Given heights of n towers and a value k. We have to either increase or decrease height of every tower by k (only once) where k > 0.
 The task is to minimise the difference between the heights of the longest and the shortest tower after modifications, and output this difference.
Examples:
Input : arr[] = {1, 15, 10}, k = 6
Output : Maximum difference is 5.
Explanation : We change 1 to 7, 15 to
9 and 10 to 4. Maximum difference is 5
(between 4 and 9). We can't get a lower
difference.
Input : arr[] = {1, 5, 15, 10}
k = 3
Output : Maximum difference is 8
arr[] = {4, 8, 12, 7}
Input : arr[] = {4, 6}
k = 10
Output : Maximum difference is 2
arr[] = {14, 16} OR {-6, -4}
Input : arr[] = {6, 10}
k = 3
Output : Maximum difference is 2
arr[] = {9, 7}
Input : arr[] = {1, 10, 14, 14, 14, 15}
k = 6
Output: Maximum difference is 5
arr[] = {7, 4, 8, 8, 8, 9}
Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
k = 2
Output: Maximum difference is 2
arr[] = {3, 4, 5}
